Mailer Configuration Reference (SwiftmailerBundle)
==================================================

.. caution::

    The Swift Mailer project is not supported since November 2021 and its
    integration with Symfony was removed in Symfony 6.0.

    Use the :doc:`Symfony Mailer </mailer>` component, which was introduced in
    Symfony 4.3 as a modern replacement of Swift Mailer.
